Run this code by the following procedures:

1. Open and run "A_registration_main.m".
2. Set the parameters, if the procedures are clearly understood. Otherwise, use the default.
3. Choose the reference image.
4. Choose the sensed image.
5. Wait for the results.

** Now this registration algorithm is an old-fashioned one, and we highly recommend checking our updated version of MS-HLMO, which is now available at https://github.com/MrPingQi/MS-HLMO_registration-v2.0
